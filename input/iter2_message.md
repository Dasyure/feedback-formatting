**Congrats on finishing the hardest part of this course! Here’s my overall thoughts on how you did for iter2:**

- Reminder: make sure you read each comment even if I gave a perfect mark.

**Below is a quick breakdown of the manual mark portion of iter2.** The majority of these marks come from style and git practices! If a section was done perfectly, I won’t have many comments. The marks range from [terrible/below average/average/good/really great/perfect]:

**Additional notes:**
- Like last time, read any comments left in the feedback merge request. If I notice a line of code with bad style, I only comment on the first instance of it, so make sure you apply the feedback everywhere.
- Automarks: check the course page. Have a look at which tests you failed (if any) as well!
- Final marks: If you find your marks differ slightly from your team mates, it’s completely normal! It’s due to the way peer review data is collected by the course.
- If your marks are significantly below your team mates, I will message you individually on MS teams with reasons why.

Proud of everyone for completing the hardest part of the course! Great job!
