**Congrats on finishing iter3 and the project!** Before I go into the breakdown of the manual marks, here's some notes:
- These sections were not marked by me: *Frontend, Results CSV, Deployment*
- Report feedback: 

The majority of these marks come from style and git practices! If a section was done perfectly, I won’t have many comments. The marks range from [terrible/below average/average/good/really great/perfect]:

**Additional notes:**
- Like last time, check the feedback merge request to see if any comments were left by me.
- If you find your marks differ slightly from your team mates, it’s completely normal! It’s due to the way peer review data is collected by the course.
- If your marks are significantly below your team mates, I will message you individually on MS teams with reasons why.

THANKS FOR THE TERM, GOODLUCK WITH EXAMS <3
