**Congrats on finishing iter1! Here’s my overall thoughts on how you did this iteration:**
- ...
- Reminder: I was lenient with marking this iteration, so make sure you read each comment even if I gave a perfect mark.

**Below is a quick breakdown of the manual mark portion of iter1.** The majority of these marks come from style and git practices! If a section was done perfectly, I won’t have many comments. The marks range from [terrible/below average/average/good/really great/perfect]:

**Additional notes:**
- Please read any comments left in the feedback merge request. It should be called “Project Feedback: Iteration 1”. If you click on the “changes” tab and scroll through the unresolved threads, you can view my comments. If I notice a line of code with bad style, I only comment on the first instance of it, so make sure you apply the feedback everywhere.
- Automarks: check the course page. Have a look at which tests you failed (if any) as well!
- Final marks: the course will release these too. If you find your marks differ slightly from your team mates, it’s completely normal! It’s due to the way peer review data is collected by the course.
- If your marks are significantly below your team mates, I will message you individually on MS teams with reasons why.

Goodluck with iter2, see you all in two weeks!
